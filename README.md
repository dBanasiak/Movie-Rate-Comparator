# Movie Rate Comparator

Comparison engine for film ratings.

## What am I doing?
The application can predict the rating of a film on a scale of 0-10 on the basis of information about the film (e.g. director, year of creation, main actors).

## How does it work
I train my engine on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) ratings. Then compares the results with those of [FilmWeb](https://www.filmweb.pl). Finally, compares the ratings of the [Rotten Tomato](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).
